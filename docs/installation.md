## Step 1 — Prepare the Asset Folders

Open your terminal in cage/

Create the required folders and copy the master data binary into place:

```bash
mkdir "lunar-tear/server/assets/release"
mkdir "lunar-tear/server/assets/master_data"
mkdir "lunar-tear/server/assets/revisions"
```

Copy/move the `.bin.e` into the release folder (keep the original at the `cage` root untouched).

Extract `resource_dump_android.7z` into `lunar-tear/server/assets/revisions/`. 

!!! tip "Tip to save space"
	Only *Revision 0* is currently necessary so you will be safe only extracting folder 0 to save on space!

---

## Step 2 — APK and Data Patching

### Quick Start

1. Open `lunar_tear_patcher.ipynb` in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. Paste your download URLs.
3. Click `Run All`.
4. Let the notebook handle everything:
   dependencies, APK patching, master data patching, and file downloads.
5. When the collab runs, it will give you `patched apk`, patched `.bin.e` and dumped json in `.zip`.
6. Place the files in their folders:
   `.bin.e` in `lunar-tear/server/assets/release`
   Extract the `.zip` in `lunar-tear/server/assets/master_data`
7. You can now skip to [Step 3](#step-3-generate-server-code).

### Manual Patching

#### Dump the Master Data

This decrypts the `.bin.e` and converts it into JSON files the server can read. Column names are resolved automatically from `lunar-scripts/schemas.json` — no external dependencies needed.

```bash
set "PYTHONUTF8=1" && python3 lunar-scripts/dump_masterdata.py  --input lunar-tear/server/assets/release/20240404193219.bin.e --output lunar-tear/server/assets/master_data
```

> This is a CMD command. If you are using PowerShell (which you shouldn't), use `$env:PYTHONUTF8 = 1; ` instead of `set "PYTHONUTF8=1" && `.<br>Also, no need for any of this on Linux.

When done, `lunar-tear/server/assets/master_data/` should be filled with `EntityM*.json` files.

#### Patch the Master Data

```bash
python3 lunar-scripts/patch_masterdata.py  --input lunar-tear/server/assets/release/20240404193219.bin.e
```

!!! question "Why?"
	This extends all content expiry dates inside the .bin.e so events, quests, and banners don't show as expired.<br>It also empties the maintenance table so the game never shows a maintenance screen.

#### Patch the APK

Decompile the APK

```bash
apktool d "NieR Re[in]carnation 3.7.1.apk" -o patched
```
Replace `100.x.x.x` with :

For Tailscale users : Tailscale IP

For Emulator users : `10.0.2.2`

```
python3 lunar-scripts/patch_apk.py patched --server-ip 100.x.x.x --http-port 8080
```
Rebuild the APK

```bash
apktool b patched -o patched.apk
zipalign -f -v 4 patched.apk patched_aligned.apk
```
!!! warning Warning
	You won't need the patched.apk in the next steps

Generate a signing key (run one-time only)
 *Skip this if you already have debug.keystore.*

```bash
keytool -genkeypair -v -keystore debug.keystore -alias androiddebugkey -storepass android -keypass android -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -dname "CN=Android Debug,O=Android,C=US"
```
Sign the APK 

```bash
apksigner sign --ks debug.keystore --ks-pass pass:android patched_aligned.apk
```
You now have `patched_aligned.apk` ready to install. 

---

## Step 3 — Generate Server Code

Open your terminal in `Cage` folder

```
cd lunar-tear/server
make proto
```
This generates Go code from the .proto files. Only needs to be done once.

---

## Step 4 — Run the Server

```
cd lunar-tear/server
go run ./cmd/lunar-tear --host 10.0.2.2 --http-port 8080 
```

!!! abstract "Saving"
	The server only saves your progress when you advance to a new story scene. Gacha pulls, purchases, and enhancements done between scene transitions are lost if the server shuts down before you reach the next checkpoint. This is a current limitation of the server.

Leave the terminal open — the server must keep running while you play.

---

## Step 5 — Install and Play

### Android phone or tablet

Install the Tailscale app from the Play Store (see [Tailscale Setup](tailscale-setup.md#tailscale-setup)), then install the patched APK:

- For Quick-start method : transfer `patched.apk` to your phone and tap to install.
- For Manual patching method : transfer `patched_aligned.apk` to your phone and tap to install.

### Android emulator (BlueStacks, MuMuPlayer...) 

Need help picking one? See [Recommended Emulators](recommended-emulators.md#recommended-emulators).

Drag and drop the `apk` onto the emulator window, or:

```
adb connect 127.0.0.1:<emulator-adb-port>
adb install patched.apk
```

Since the emulator runs on the same PC as the server, Tailscale isn't required for home use.

> If you're using the emulator on a **different PC away from home**, install Tailscale on that PC and it will route through automatically.

### Make sure the server is running before launching the game.
